CONJUNCTIONS
What is a conjunction?
A conjunction is the glue that holds words, phrases and clauses (both dependent and independent) together. There are three different kinds of conjunctions - coordinating, subordinating, and correlative - each serving its own, distinct purpose, but all working to bring words together.
Thanks to conjunctions, we don't have to write short, choppy sentences. We can extend our lines with simple words like "and" or "but" and perhaps a comma or two. 

TYPES OF CONJUNCTIONS
There are three major types of conjunctions. They are:
1. Coordinating Conjunction
2. Subordinating Conjunction
3. Correlative Conjunction

COORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS
Coordinating conjunctions join words, phrases, or clauses having similar grammatical structure. A coordinating conjunction is also called a coordinator. With the coordinating conjunctions, short and choppy sentences can be joined into fuller lines.
 Take a look at this example: I like cooking. I like eating. I don't like washing dishes afterwards. 
These three simple sentences can be made into one complex and elegant sentence and avoid the choppiness of multiple short sentences. Those sentences now become: I like cooking and eating, but I don't like washing dishes afterwards.
There are seven coordinating conjunctions, and they are easy to remember if you can just think of the acronym "FANBOYS".
1. For - Explains reason or purpose
2. And - Adds one thing to another.
3. Nor - Used to present an alternative negative idea to an already stated negative idea.
4. But - Shows contrast
5. Or - Presents an alternative or a choice.
6. Yet - Introduces a contrasting idea that follows the preceding idea logically.
7. So - Indicates effect, result or consequence.
Examples of coordinating conjunction used in sentences.
i. I go to the park every Sunday, for I love to watch the ducks on the lake.
ii. I watch the ducks on the lake and the shirtless men playing soccer.
iii. I don't go for the fresh air nor for the ducks; I just like soccer.
iv. Soccer is entertaining in winter, but it's better in the heat of summer.
v. The men play on two teams: shirts or skins.
vi. I always take a book to read, yet I never seem to turn a single page.
vii. I'm dating one of the players, so I watch the soccer game each week.

SUBORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS
What is a subordinating conjunction?
A subordinating conjunction always introduces a dependent clause, tying it to an independent clause.
Unlike coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions can often come first in a sentence. This is because of the nature of the relationship between the dependent and independent clauses.
In English, there are lots of subordinating conjunctions. Here are the most common examples:
although
before
once
that
when
whether
as
how
since
though
whenever
while
because
if
than
until
where
why etc
Examples of Subordinating Conjunctions used in sentences:
i. Because of him, I learned how to start my own business.
ii. Everything will fall into place if you start at the beginning.
iii. Until you try, you'll never know.
iv. I add a new entry to my gratitude journal when I wake in the morning.
v. As I write this letter, I know I must say goodbye.
vi. Life's been so happy since I moved to Badagry.

CORRELATIVE CONJUNCTIONS
What are correlative conjunctions?
Correlative conjunctions are tag - team conjunctions. They come in pairs, and you have to use both of them in different places in a sentence to make them work. These conjunctions work together (co-) and relate one sentence to another. Correlative conjunctions connect two equal grammatical terms. So if a noun follows "both", then a noun should also follow "and".
Common pairs include:
both... and
whether...or
either...or
neither...nor
not...but
not only...but also
Examples in sentences
i. I want either the pink or the purple one.
ii. I'll study both English Literature and Art History.
iii. I didn't know whether you'd want milk or cream so I grabbed both.
iv. Why do you want to visit neither Ireland nor Scotland?
v. I took not only the pink sofa but also the Tiffany lamp.
vi. Not the cheeseburger for me, but definitely the fries.
